# Clerk Authentication Setup - Next.js App Router

This project has been configured with Clerk authentication using the latest App Router approach.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Clerk API Keys

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Create a new application or select an existing one
3. Navigate to the [API Keys page](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)
4. Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your keys:

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
```

**Important:** Never commit your actual API keys to version control. The `.env.local` file is already excluded by `.gitignore`.

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app with authentication!

## 📁 What's Been Set Up

### ✅ Files Created/Modified

- **`middleware.ts`** - Clerk middleware using `clerkMiddleware()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
- **`app/layout.tsx`** - Root layout wrapped with `<ClerkProvider>` and authentication UI
- **`app/page.tsx`** - Home page with conditional content based on authentication status
- **`.gitignore`** - Already configured to exclude `.env*` files

### ✅ Clerk Components Integrated

- `<ClerkProvider>` - Wraps the entire app
- `<SignInButton>` & `<SignUpButton>` - Authentication entry points
- `<UserButton>` - User profile management
- `<SignedIn>` & `<SignedOut>` - Conditional rendering based on auth state

### ✅ Security Features

- Environment variables properly configured
- Middleware protecting routes
- `.env*` files excluded from git
- Latest Clerk SDK installed

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Add your API keys** to `.env.local` (see step 2 above)
2. **Test authentication** by signing up/in
3. **Create protected routes** using Clerk's auth helpers
4. **Customize the user experience** with Clerk's components
5. **Add organization features** if needed

## 🔧 Architecture

This setup follows Clerk's official App Router pattern:
- Uses `clerkMiddleware()` (not the deprecated `authMiddleware`)
- App Router structure (`app/` directory)
- Latest `@clerk/nextjs` package
- Proper environment variable configuration
