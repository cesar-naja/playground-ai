#### **Language Support:**
```javascript
const languages = [
  { code: 'english', name: 'English', flag: '🇺🇸' },

2. **Image URL converted to blob** → Using server-side API route
3. **Upload to Firebase Storage** → Unique path with metadata
4. **Save metadata to Firestore** → Clean data without undefined values
